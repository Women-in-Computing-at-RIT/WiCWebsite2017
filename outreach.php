                                <p>Girls as young as eight-years-old used their laptops, imagination and teamwork skills for social good at ROCGirlHacks Powered by AT&amp;T, Rochester’s first all-girl youth hackathon hosted Oct. 28 at Rochester Institute of Technology. </p>
                                <p>
                                The free hackathon was intended for all girls in grades 3–12, including those who have never programmed before, those who are already building apps and anyone in between. The learning program challenged participants to come up with technological solutions and tools to address the growing problem of cyberbullying and internet safety.
                                The event was a collaboration between iCanCode, Women in Computing at RIT and AT&amp;T. The program was born out of a desire to expand coding opportunities for Rochester-area girls and to encourage them to enter the field of technology, specifically coding, an industry that is statistically male-dominant.</p>

                                <p>Women in Compputing’s pre-orientation program will provide incoming female computing students with early access to the RIT experience, helping them to prepare for success and increase confidence. They will meet faculty of the Golisano College of Computing through engaging labs that will help to expand their knowledge about different applications for the technologies that they will be learning about during the year. They will get to know fellow women classmates, both in their year and upperclassmen while participating in our great team activities! It also includes a trip to the Strong National Museum of Play.</p>
